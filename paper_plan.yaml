## COSMOS paper pipeline plan (v1)
##
## This plan is intentionally explicit and stable for reproducibility.
## The pipeline performs strict validation that all REQUIRED jobs are present.
##
## Notes:
## - "seeds" is the number of seeds. Seed values used are 0..(seeds-1).
## - "cluster_suite" (if present) is run as a single invocation (not a seeded loop).

seeds: 200
tmax: 200
max_events: 200000
